#As the Person in Need
* I want to find resources for me and my family so that I can improve my quality of life.
* I want to go to a single place to discover resources so that I can save my energy from doing all the legwork to obtain the resources on my own.
* I want to keep the reason why I'm visiting the site private so that I can control who knows that I'm searching for resources.
* I want to find information privately on the internet, without having to talk to someone so I can feel autonomous and conduct my search at any time of day.
* I want results customized to my needs so that I don't need to spend time searching through resources that are not a good fit for me.
* I want a limited number of questions so that I don't feel like I am being interrogated and my search is efficient.
* I want to see at least 3 general resources provided so I don't feel discouraged once I receive my results.
* I want to have my results saved on return to the web page so I can return to the website to view my customized results again.

#As the Social Worker
* I want a tool to quickly find resources for my clients so that I can spend more time coordinating services than searching for them.

#As the Developer
* I want to make sure I have the framework to scale/expand to add features through use of constructor functions for easy expansion of our website in the future.
* I want to work from an agreed on wireframe to have a general design/styling direction so there is a cohesive design that is aesthetically pleasing.
* I want to have a clear mapping between user objects and resource objects so we can easily match a user's needs to the resources in our database.
* I want to use proper syntax and conventions so the code is readable and easily maintained.

#As a New Organization Resource
* I want my information to be most up to date so there are zero misconceptions about offered services.
* I want my services to be easily found so we can help as many people as possible.
* I want my offerings to be clear and concise on our services and constraints so there are zero misconceptions about offered services.
* I want to be able to add my service to the site through a form describing what we offer so there are less frustration on updating our offerings.
